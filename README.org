This is a fork of Henrik Lissner [[https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles][dotfiles]] project. I used it a starting point
for my own dotfiles. Credit for the organization of this project goes to him.

A tidy =$HOME= is a tidy mind.

These are my dotfiles, designed primarily for Arch Linux, MacOS and
debian. They are my specific breed of madness, split into 2-level topics
(e.g.Â =shell/zsh=) that strive for minimum =$HOME= presence (adhering to
XDG standards where possible).

** Dotfile management

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Usage: deploy [-acdlLit] [TOPIC...]

      -a   Target all enabled topics (ignores TOPIC args)
      -c   Afterwards, remove dead symlinks & empty dot-directories in $HOME.
           Can be used alone.
      -d   Unlink and run `./_init clean` for topic(s)
      -l   Only relink topic(s) (implies -i)
      -L   List enabled topics
      -i   Inhibit install/update/clean init scripts
      -t   Do a test run; do not actually do anything
#+END_EXAMPLE

e.g. + =deploy base/arch shell/{zsh,tmux}=: enables base/arch, shell/zsh
& shell/tmux + =deploy -d shell/zsh=: disables shell/zsh & cleans up
after it + =deploy -l shell/zsh=: refresh links for shell/zsh (inhibits
init script) + =deploy -l=: relink all enabled topics + =deploy -L=:
list all enabled topics

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd $topic
    if [[ -L $DOTFILES_DATA/${topic//\//.}.topic ]]; then
        ./_init update
    else
        ln -sfv $DOTFILES/$topic $DOTFILES_DATA/${topic//\//.}.topic

        ./_init install
        ./_init link
    fi
